# We fear this Night

We fear this night. Haunted by our past.\
Build our foe form despair and weakness.

Slaughtered in a haunted swamp as a sacrifice to the gods.\
Slaughtered cause of hopelessness instead of fighting it head on.\
Awaken from his quiet sleep, hear the groaning of the Alf.\
Searching for the other half of his gifted talisman.\
Hanging from his daughters neck...\
as the next sacrifice....

We fear this night. Haunted by our past.\
Build our foe form despair and weakness.

And he could never hurt her.\
Set her free with the first light of dawn.\
Dawn is just a heartbeat away...\
Hope is just a sunrise away...

Just home they caught her again. The first ever free sacrifice.\
Just home Edgrim rescued her, moving to his hut in the swamp.\
Fighting for his talisman, killing Edgrim, there is he the Alf.\
Rescued by the heros here, they run to daughters home.\
Followed by the angry Alf...\
Seeking to tear it down....

We fear this night. Haunted by our past.\
Build our foe form despair and weakness.

And though the Alfs fac's filled with Anger.\
Wulflind, her mom, rush's out and takes him down.

We feared this night. Overcame our past.\
Learned our faults, now stand strong with us all.

We feared this night. Overcame our past.\
Learned our faults, now stand strong with us all.

And we will never despair.\
Rather die than submit to the swamp.\
Dawn is just a heartbeat away...\
Hope is just a sunrise away...
