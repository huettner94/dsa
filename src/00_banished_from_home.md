# Banished from Home

Our home was burnt to the ground.\
Only few of us got out.\
Hranngars daemons killed most of our guild\
and drove us out to the sea.

Banished from home.\
Nowhere to go.\
Our ottas are sailing, the shore out of view.\
With the wind and our strength\
through seas where no one yet has sailed.\
Lead by our trust, in our god, Swafnir.

Legends tell of a new world\
on the other oceans end.\
So we set sail, to win, this new land.
And though what we will find there\
we cannot tell.\
We saved who we could\
but more feast than should\
with our white whale.

Many battles we have been.\
Many dead we have seen.\
But we won't forget\
nor will we regret\
our challenge to Hranngar.

In the far we see the shore\
where our home now will be.\
So we set sail, to win, this new land.
And though what we will find there\
we cannot tell.\
We saved who we could\
but more feast than should\
with our white whale.

So we will live, and we'll drink, for Swafnir.
