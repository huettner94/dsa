# Rescue Us

Sit down\
And listen to our past\
you travel with us\
from our heights to our end\
Sleep now\
And see how our lives have been before\
We where sailing\
Away from this cities shore

What do you fear?\
What is this worry in your face?\
Faaar to soon\
All of this fear will turn to rage\
We have been played\
Misstrust here everyone

What can you find\
Within the past?\
Can you find who here lied?\
And free us from\
our old doom\
our ships then come to carry us home

Once you wake up\
hold up your vow\
you cant change the past\
but act now

Time runs\
we nearly fade away\
but with your effort\
you can uncover the truth\
Don't stay\
We have come now to the end\
Our halls are calling\
You and I will meet again\
And you'll be there in my arms\
Just drinking

What can you find\
Within the past?\
Can you find who here lied?\
And free us from\
our old doom\
our ships then come to carry us home

Once you wake up\
hold up your vow\
you cant change the past\
but act now\
rescue us
