# Grey Mountains Cold

On the peak  of grey mountains cold\
where ore is free  in lodes old\
Far from the sea  we mine it free\
To feed our home  with bars we sold

After years  the iron veins die out\
We need this ore  no plant would sprout\
Without our trade  we must vacate\
I as their lead  need a way out

In my dreams  Agrimoth came to stroll\
He offered luck  for my soul\
To find new vein  it's worth the pain\
I as their lead  must pay this toll

Next morning  i tried to test my luck\
dug in the wall  and ore i struck\
it's coin i hear  we can stay here\
for all this rock  we need our truck

On the peak  of grey mountains cold\
where ore is free  in lodes old\
Far from the sea  we mine it free\
To feed our home  with bars we sold

In next days  i find more veins of ore\
but to survive  we will need more\
we must prepare  for ore be scare\
we need a hoard  we must have more

My people  start questioning my luck\
say in despair  a daemon snuck\
I'm not possessed  I am just blessed\
I must protect  them from bad luck

I need strength  to save them all from packs\
HE offers me  to guard our backs\
what are some lives  we're save from fights\
we can now trust  my arm's pickaxe

On the peak  of grey mountains cold\
with loads of ore  from daemon old\
with all them dead  and some have fled\
I stay to guard  alone our hold
