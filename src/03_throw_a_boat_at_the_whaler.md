# Throw a boat at the whaler

When adventures of\
seawulf ott(a)jasko\
went out for a ship ride\
with Jandra's stormbirds

From when we left Olport\
to the open sea\
turned straight to the west\
not knowing what we'd () see

Next morning the rain\
pours down like gods cry\
came with a storm and\
we though we would die

fog starts the next day\
followed by some whales\
get caught by a wahler\
"We'll get your entails"

Throw a boat at the whaler\
Oh, Swafnir you white whale\
Oh, Swafnir you white whale, oh\
Throw a boat at the whaler\
Let all hunters get pale

Through the full night we hunt\
the sinners of the south\
find them next morning\
with yet a full mouth

We then board their ship\
while singing our chants\
are slaying most of the fools\
they shit their pants

Swafnir adds a blow\
on the ship of foe\
rises up in the air high\
and then he will throw

Now we all can cheer\
together we set fear\
defeated the hunters\
now give us some beer

Throw a boat at the whaler\
Oh, Swafnir you white whale\
Oh, Swafnir you white whale, oh\
Throw a boat at the whaler\
Let all hunters get pale

Throw a boat at the whaler\
Oh, Swafnir you white whale\
Oh, Swafnir you white whale, oh\
Throw a boat at the whaler\
Let all hunters get pale

Throw a boat at the whaler\
Oh, Swafnir you white whale\
Oh, Swafnir you white whale, oh\
Throw a boat at the whaler\
Let all hunters get pale
